# Edgewater Inn

With UX in mind, I laid out the content in a easily digestible way so that when a guest gets to the website they can do what they want to do. I created this responsive website with HTML, Sass/CSS, and JQuery.

Below you see three view-ports, small, medium, and large. When making websites I use the mobile first approach and this leaves no device size out. I start with the smallest view-port, then expand and create breakpoints when necessary.
