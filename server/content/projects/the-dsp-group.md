# The DSP Group

I used HTML, Sass/CSS, and JQuery to bring this site from a desktop site to responsive site.

Below you see three view-ports, small, medium, and large. When making websites I use the mobile first approach and this leaves no device size out. I start with the smallest view-port, then expand and create breakpoints when necessary.
