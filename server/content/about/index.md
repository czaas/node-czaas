# About Me

I have been living in Central Coast California since 2008. I am a family man, I enjoy being outdoors, playing board games, video games, and have always been interested in technology.

## Family

I'm a proud husband and father of two. Emily, Liam, and Dylan are my world. We spend many days at the park, beach, and ah sir bounce a lot (indoor bounce center!).

## Archery

I've been shooting archery for over a year now and it is the most relaxing and enjoyable thing I've found in a long time.

I made it to the Chamberlin Archery Tournement in April 2017 where I met some great people and had a lot of fun shooting. I will definitely be back next year!
