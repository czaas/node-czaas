# Swim CCS

I used HTML, Sass/CSS, and JQuery to make this existing site responsive.

Below you see three view-ports, small, medium, and large. When making websites I use the mobile first approach and this leaves no device size out. I start with the smallest view-port, then expand and create breakpoints when necessary.
