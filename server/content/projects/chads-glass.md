# Chad's Glass

This site reaches out to instagram for the first 20 or so posts and displays them in a grid. You can pull up the modal by clicking on one of the thumbnails. Videos have a video icon in the top right corner.

As you scroll down the page you will see a loading indicator, once you see this, the page reaches out to instagram and loads the next 20 until there are no more posts from him.

I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp" target="_blank">hyperapp js</a> library which I was drawn to after looking through the github repo. It has a simple state, actions, and view management which allowed for a very smooth development.
