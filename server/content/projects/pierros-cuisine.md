# Pierros Cuisine

For a restaurant, the mobile websites must be well laid out. Most people that navigate to a restaurant want to know a few things off the away; hours, menu, reservations, and a form of contact. I used HTML, Sass/CSS, and JavaScript to give this restaurant a responsive website that the users want.

With these ideas in mind I went and created what I, as a consumer, would like to see upon navigating to their web-page. Right away you see can make reservation. Then below there's a slider displaying what the restaurant looks like. Finally you see menus with the times they are served.

Below you see three view-ports, small, medium, and large. When making websites I use the mobile first approach and this leaves no device size out. I start with the smallest view-port, then expand and create breakpoints when necessary.
