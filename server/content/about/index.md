# About Me

I have been living in Central Coast California since 2008. I am a family man, I enjoy being outdoors, playing board games and video games, and have always been interested in technology.

## Archery

I've been shooting archery for over a year now and it is the most relaxing and enjoyable thing I've found in a long time.

I made it to the Chamberlin Archery Tournement in April 2017 where I met some great people and had a lot of fun shooting. I will definitely be back next year!
