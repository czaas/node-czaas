# Animal Selctor

Following <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/motion/material-motion.html" target="_blank">Google's material design and motion guidelines</a> I built a little demo to show transform 3d events in action.

Using React and Styled-Components library I whipped together a full screen that flys in based on the selected animal toggling the direction from left to right as the animal card leaves the screen.
