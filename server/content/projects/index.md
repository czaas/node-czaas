## Pierros Cuisine

<a href="/projects/pierros-cuisine">![Mann Pools Logo](/images/pierros-cuisine-logo.jpg)</a>

For a restaurant, the mobile websites must be well laid out. Most people that navigate to a restaurant want to know a few things off the bat; hours, menu, reservations, and a form of contact. I used HTML, SASS/CSS, and Javascript to give this restaurant a responsive website that the users want.

## Bomar Security Web App

<a href="/projects/bomar-security-app">![Bomar Security Logo](/images/bomar-security-logo.jpg)</a>

I focused heavily on the UX when I created this so the guards can spend less time looking at the screen of the device they were using and more on securing the area they were in. I made this with HTML, SASS/CSS, and Javascript.

## Edgewater Inn

With UX in mind, I laid out the content in a easily digestible way so that when a guest gets to the website they can do what they want to do. I created this responsive website with HTML, SASS/CSS, and JQuery.
